You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `'/'`, `'\'` or `' '`(an empty space).
write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.

for example, suppose the input for a 3 X 6 grid is the following : 

      123456
    1 \    / 
    2  \  / 
    3   \/ 

consider the edges of a matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three traingles,
so you should return `3`.
