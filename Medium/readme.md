|  1.    |[1216]        |You are given an `N` by `M` 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the `minimum number of columns` that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically.                               |       |
|  2.  |[1225]        |Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid                               |       |
|  3.   |[1230]        |Given a list of words, return the shortest unique prefix of each word.                                |       |
|  4.   |[1232]        |You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `'/'`, `'\'` or `' '`(an empty space). write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.                               |   ✔️    |
|  5.  |[1236]        |Write a function, `throw_dice(N, faces, total)`, that determines how many ways it is possible to throw `N` dice with some number of faces each to get a specific total.
|  6.   |[1224]        |Given a binary search tree and a range `[a, b]` (inclusive), return the sum of the elements of the binary search tree within the range.                               |       |
|  7.   |[1226]        |Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.                           |       |
|  8.   |[1231]        |The area of circle is defined as pi*r^2. Estimate pi to 3 decimal places using Monte Carlo method.                         |  ✔️     |
|  9.   |[1235]        |Given the root to a binary tree, implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree.                               |       |
|  10.   |[1239]        |Implement division of two positive integers without using the division, multiplication, or modulus operators. Return the quotient as an integer, ignoring the remainder.
