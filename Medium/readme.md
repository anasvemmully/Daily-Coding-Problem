|  1.    |[1209]        | Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair of elements in the `subset (i, j)` satisfies either `i % j = 0` or `j % i = 0`. |   ✔️    |
|  2.    |[1211]        | Given a stack of `N` elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. |   ✔️    |
|  3.    |[1212]  🤷  | Implement a bit array.|   ✔️    |
|  4.    |[1214]        |Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's itinerary.                                |       |
|  5.    |[1216]        |You are given an `N` by `M` 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the `minimum number of columns` that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically.                               |    ✔️   |
|  6.  |[1225]        |Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid                               |   ✔️     |
|  7.   |[1230]        |Given a list of words, return the shortest unique prefix of each word.                                |       |
|  8.   |[1232]        |You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `'/'`, `'\'` or `' '`(an empty space). write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.                               |   ✔️    |
|  9.  |[1236]        |Write a function, `throw_dice(N, faces, total)`, that determines how many ways it is possible to throw `N` dice with some number of faces each to get a specific total.
|  10.   |[1224]        |Given a binary search tree and a range `[a, b]` (inclusive), return the sum of the elements of the binary search tree within the range.                               |    ✔️   |
|  11.   |[1226]        |Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.                           |       |
|  12.   |[1231]        |The area of circle is defined as pi*r^2. Estimate pi to 3 decimal places using Monte Carlo method.                         |  ✔️     |
|  13.   |[1235]        |Given the root to a binary tree, implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree.  
|  14.   |[1238]        |Given a string, find the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters as possible anywhere in the word.                               |       |
|  15.   |[1239]        |Implement division of two positive integers without using the division, multiplication, or modulus operators. Return the quotient as an integer, ignoring the remainder.
|  16.   |[1240]        |Given a number of bits n, generate a possible gray code for it.| ✔️  |
|  17.   |[1241]        |Given a list of `N` people and the above operation, find a way to identify the celebrity in `O(N)` time.|   |
|  18.   |[1242]        |Given a start word, an end word, and a dictionary of valid words, find the shortest transformation sequence from start to end.|   |
|  19.   |[1244]        |If at most two people can fit in a rescue boat, and the maximum weight limit for a given boat is k, determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.| ✔️  |
|  20.   |[1245]        | Write an algorithm to justify text. Given a sequence of words and an integer line length k, return a list of strings which represents each line, fully justified.|   |
|  21.   |[1172]        | Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree. |   |
|  22.   |[1167]        | Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the `pow(x, y)` function, where `x` and `y` are integers and returns `x^y`.  |   |
|  23.   |[1166]        | Given a 2-D matrix representing an image, a location of a pixel in the screen and a color `C`, replace the color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with `C`. |   |
