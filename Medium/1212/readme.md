Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a bit array.

A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of `1` or `0` at each index.

 - `init(size)`: initialize the array with size
 - `set(i, val)`: updates index at `i` with `val` where `val` is either `1` or `0`.
 - `get(i)`: gets the value at index `i`.
