You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `'/'`, `'\'` or `' '`(an empty space).
write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.

for example, suppose the input for a 3 X 6 grid is the following : 

&nbsp;&nbsp;  123456\
1 \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / \
2 &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; / \
3 &nbsp; &nbsp;  \ / 

consider the edges of a matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three traingles,
so you should return `3`.
