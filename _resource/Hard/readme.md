| 1.|[1213]| Write an algorithm that pairs the men and women together in such a way that no two people of opposite sex would both rather be with each other than with their current partners.
| 1.|[1218]|Implement 3 stacks using a single list
| 2.|[1223]|You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form (lr), where l corresponds to the left child and r corresponds to the right child.
| 3.|[1233]|Given an array of strictly the characters `'R'`, `'G'`, and `'B'`, segregate the values of the array so that all the `R`s come first, the `G`s come second, and the `B`s come last.
| 4.|[1174]| Given a string, return whether it represents a number. 
| 5.|[1173]| Given a sequence `S`, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.
| 6.|[1169]| Given a list of points, a central point, and an integer k, find the nearest k points from the central point.
| 7.|[1165]|  After `k` moves, what is the probability that the knight remains on the board?
| 8.|[1162]| Write a function that returns the maximum number of edges you can remove while still satisfying this requirement.
